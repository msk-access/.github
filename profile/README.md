# Welcome

The [CMO Cell-Free DNA Informatics](https://cmo-ci.gitbook.io/cci/) (CCI) groupâ€™s mission is to develop and apply computational methods to organize, analyze and understand genomic data generated from cfDNA assays such as MSK-ACCESS. The group is responsible for all computational infrastructure needed to deploy, run, and deliver results for research cfDNA assays in a production setting for [Center for Molecular Oncology](https://www.mskcc.org/research-programs/molecular-oncology) (CMO) at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org) (MSKCC).
