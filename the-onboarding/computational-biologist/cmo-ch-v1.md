# CMO-CH V1

## What is CMO-CH assay?

CMO-CH is offered by the Center for Molecular Oncology (CMO) to MSK researchers for profiling white blood cell DNA to detect mutations in the most commonly altered [clonal hematopoiesis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31672865/) (CH) associated genes.&#x20;

## What is the panel design?

* 596 targets capturing 58% of CH and 90.4% of CH-PD mutations identified in the latest CH dataset from 40K patients
* Total size = 1,143 probes (0.14 Mb)
* Full gene coverage for TP53, TET2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, PPM1D, CHEK2, ASXL1, ATM, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and U2AF2â€¢Additional targets with hotspot positions from IMPACT heme assay
* SNP tiling around TP53, CBL, MPL, JAK2, EZH2, TET2, RUNX1, and ATM (+/-10kb) to identify allelic-imbalances
* 40 fingerprint SNPs that are shared with all other NGS assays (IMPACT, ACCESS, WES etc.) to detect sample mismatches
